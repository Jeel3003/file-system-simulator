# File System Simulator

This Python project simulates a basic in-memory file system with support for commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, and `touch`. The file system is held in memory, and any changes made during the program's execution are lost when the program ends.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   - git clone https://github.com/Jeel3003/file-system-simulator.git
   - cd file-system-simulator
   ```
2. **Run the Project:**

    ```
    python main.py
    ```
This will start the interactive file system simulator. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various file system operations.

Example:

```
- Enter command (ls, mkdir, cd, touch, exit): mkdir documents
- Enter command (ls, mkdir, cd, touch, exit): cd documents
- Enter command (ls, mkdir, cd, touch, exit): touch file1.txt
```

Exit the Simulator:

To exit the simulator, type exit and press Enter.
